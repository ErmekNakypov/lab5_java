# Task4
Design a system for managing employees in a company. The system should have a base class for employees with attributes such as name, ID, salary, and hire date. It should also have derived classes for different types of employees, such as managers, developers, and salespeople, each with their specific attributes and methods. 
The system should allow adding, removing, and modifying employees. It should also be able to calculate and display employee salaries, bonuses, and performance metrics. Additionally, the system should be able to generate reports, such as employee lists, department-wise salary summaries, and annual performance reviews. 
Implement the system in Java using appropriate inheritance and interface mechanisms.
